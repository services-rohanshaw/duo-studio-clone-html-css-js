## Code Explanation

The code for this site is divided into two files: index.html and style.css.

index.html is the main HTML file for the site. It contains the markup for the header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer.

style.css is the main CSS file for the site. It contains the styles for the header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer.

The site also uses a few JavaScript libraries, including Locomotive Scroll and ScrollTrigger. Locomotive Scroll is used to create the smooth scrolling effect on the site, and ScrollTrigger is used to trigger animations when the user scrolls.
